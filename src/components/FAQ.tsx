  // Competitive Analysis
  {
    q: "How quickly will I receive my competitive analysis report?",
    a: "Most reports are delivered within 24 hours of your request. For more complex engagements or industries with many competitors, I'll let you know upfront if it will take longer.",
  },
  {
    q: "What industries do you cover?",
    a: "Any industry with an online presence — coworking, retail, professional services, hospitality, SaaS, healthcare, restaurants, and more. If your competitors have websites, I can analyze them.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from just Googling my competitors?",
    a: "The report pulls real traffic estimates, SEO gap analysis, review velocity, and Google Business Profile health — then synthesizes it all into a prioritized action plan. It would take a full day of manual research to replicate what I deliver in a structured, print-ready PDF.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get a report for a competitor outside the US?",
    a: "Yes — the analysis works for any market with an online footprint. Just mention the target geography when you submit your request.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I'm not satisfied with the report?",
    a: "If the report doesn't meet your expectations, reach out within 48 hours and I'll revise it. My goal is a deliverable you can act on immediately.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer refunds?",
    a: "Because each report involves real research time, I don't offer refunds after delivery. If you have questions about scope before ordering, contact me first — I'm happy to talk through what you'll get.",
  },
  // Workflow Automation
  {
    q: "What kinds of tasks can you automate?",
    a: "Common examples: customer follow-up sequences, lead intake and CRM updates, invoice reminders, appointment scheduling, weekly reporting, and social media content workflows. If something is repetitive and rule-based, it's usually automatable.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need any technical knowledge to use what you build?",
    a: "No. Everything I deliver is built for normal people to run day-to-day. I write plain-language documentation and do a live walkthrough with you before handoff. You won't need a developer.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does pricing work for automation projects?",
    a: "I scope each project individually and give you a fixed-fee proposal before any work begins. No hourly rates, no surprise invoices. If the proposal doesn't make sense for your budget, you're under no obligation.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a typical automation project take?",
    a: "It varies by scope. Simple automations (a single workflow or integration) typically take 1–2 weeks from kickoff to handoff. More complex projects with multiple systems can take 3–4 weeks. I give you a timeline estimate in the proposal.",
  },
  // General
  {
    q: "Is my information kept confidential?",
    a: "Yes. Your company name, industry, and any details you share are used solely to produce your deliverable. I don't share client information with third parties.",
  },
