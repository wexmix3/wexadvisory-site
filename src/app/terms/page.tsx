            <p>
              Wex Advisory provides competitive intelligence reports and related advisory services
              to businesses. The scope, deliverables, and fees for each engagement are agreed upon
              prior to commencement of work.

            <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-lg mb-3">2. Payment</h2>
            <p>
              Payment is due prior to delivery of reports unless otherwise agreed in writing.
              All fees are stated in US dollars. We reserve the right to update our pricing at any
              time; pricing changes will not affect confirmed engagements.

            <p>
              Because each report requires significant research and analysis time, we do not offer
              refunds after delivery. If you have concerns about the deliverable, contact us within
              48 hours of receipt and we will work to address them. If you have questions about scope
              before ordering, please contact us first.

            <p>
              All information you provide — including your company name, competitive context, and
              business details — is kept strictly confidential. We do not share client information
              with third parties.

              Upon full payment, you receive a non-exclusive license to use the report for your
              internal business purposes. Reports may not be resold or redistributed without written
              permission.

            <p>
              Reports are based on publicly available data and third-party data sources. While we
              strive for accuracy, we do not guarantee that all data is complete or error-free.
              Reports reflect conditions at the time of research and should not be construed as
              legal, financial, or investment advice.
